While running game code:
  File "game/scenes/introduction.rpy", line 34, in script call
    "YOU HAVE NOT UNLOCKED THE STUDY"
  File "game/screens/arrest.rpy", line 6, in script
    call screen ui_arrest
  File "renpy/common/000statements.rpy", line 531, in execute_call_screen
    store._return = renpy.call_screen(name, *args, **kwargs)
Exception: Screen ui_arrest is not known.
